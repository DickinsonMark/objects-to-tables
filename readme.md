# Objects to Tables

A brief example on connecting the browser to a server to a database.

## Steps to Take

**What's the initial input? What's the output?**

> User goes to `/contacts` and they see a list of contacts stored in a file/database.

**What's the roadmap to get there?**

> There can be many! Let's do the following:

>   1. Setup a basic Node/Express Application

>   1. Create a `/contacts` route that returns a static HTML page

>   1. Add dummy data as a JS Object

>   1. Return that dummy data dynamically on the rendered HTML page

>   1. Create database configuration, database, and tables

>   1. Connect database to Node/Express application in place of the JS Object
